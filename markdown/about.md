# Getting Started

## What is Bitmono?

Bit Mono is a free open-source C# obfuscator that in most cases
works only with Mono - well known as a fork of .NET Framework but
with custom bugs or Unity. Which uses its own fork of dnlib for
assembly manipulation. If you have any questions/issues please let
me know there. You can install latest version of Bit Mono here.

## How your app will look since BitMono obfuscation - just in a few words

- Seems to C++ application but this is an actual C# application
- Crash of decompilers when analyzing types
- Broken decompilers
- Broken IL Code
- Invisible types
- No code
